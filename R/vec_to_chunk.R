#' Variable vector into chunks.
#'
#' \code{vec_to_chunk} takes a list of variables and collects them into 50-variable chunks.
#' 
#' This function takes a list of variable names and collects them into chunks with no more than 
#' 50 variables each. This helps to get around requests with more than 50 variables,because the 
#' API only allows queries of 50 variables at a time. 
#' The user should not need to call this function directly.
#'
#' @param x Character vector of variable names.
#' @return Object of class \code{list}.

#' @examples
